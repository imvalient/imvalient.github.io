<h1>Jenkins Built From Code</h1>


<p>It has been already two years since I started working with Jenkins. My daily duty goes from, supervise the execution of prehistoric Jobs to satisfy a complex and pretty old app deployment, to mantain and enahance declarative multibranch pipelines with the main goal of achiveing a continuous integration and continuous deployment set of phases that promotes packaged software through a lot of environments untill it reaches the client hands.</p>

<p>Reaching out such a level of automation involves, time, teams &amp; processes. From my experience working in a big company, It&rsquo;s a task that requires a lot of time and effort, everyone involved on the Software Development &amp; Delivery proccess has to take hands on this new way of thinking &amp; working, and adapt to it.</p>

<p>After spreading a bit my thoughs on the Devops culture, I would like to focus once again on the Jenkins topic. I spend most of my time working between environments and for each environment I work on a completely different Jenkins, actually I test new features from fancy plugins that improves and clarifies the Software Delivery proccess on a Dev environment and once I verify the new feature works well I spend more time promoting it to the rest of the environments. This sounds like a repetitive task, actually I tend to avoid this kind of tasks, for over the years I persue the adoption of EaC (<em>laughs</em>), Everything as Code, but for some reason I had no chance to apply it yet on the Jenkins installation scope.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s the main topic, I found a weakness on my daily duty, I am trying to achieve a proper fix and I&rsquo;ll write about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal.</h2>

<p>&ndash; Conclusions
[*] There are plenty of better approaches for the multi environment deployment procedure. I guess most of the people thinks that a single Jenkins across all the environments could do the job, and that&rsquo;s right but it also depends on multiple factors, the one I hold to is having complete isolated environments, with independent data centers and network settings. When you work for big companies you have to adapt to the technical debt and way of working, and try to minimize its impact step by step without neglecting customer main needs.</p>
