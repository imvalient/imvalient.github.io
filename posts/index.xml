      <description>It has been already two years since I started working with Jenkins. My daily duty goes from, supervise the execution of prehistoric Jobs to satisfy a complex and pretty old app deployment, to mantain and enahance declarative multibranch pipelines with the main goal of achiveing a continuous integration and continuous deployment set of phases that promotes packaged software through a lot of environments untill it reaches the client hands.</description>
